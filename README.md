# ShootAndRun-MatrixProject
This repository is made for the Introduction to Robotics Course, in particular for the Matrix Project.
# Backstory 
Shoot and Run is an idea that started as a one-level game, with simple mechanincs.
The exploration of a wider space in order to try different levels is inspired by Dredge, a map exploration game. <br>
All of the levels are custom-made, thought as to get different vibes and difficulties along the way.
# Goal and How to Play
In this game, your goal is to explore all of the maps, and try to have as high of a score as possible. Everything you do in a run contributes to your score!<br>
There are two types of maps: exploration and level. <br>
The exploration maps allow for expansion, as you will have to pay with your earned money to buy new ones. <br>
The level maps are where all of the action happens. This is where you get to shoot and run!<br>
The score is made up by how many enemies you kill, multiplied by a level multiplier, that increases based on difficulty and position on expansion maps.
After each level you get coins, again multiplied depending on the level.
You lose the game and all of your progress when you reach 0 lives.
You start with five, but you can buy more in the shop.<br>
This shop has more to offer: fatigue potion for your enemies that makes their shooting intervals larger, and expansion maps.<br>
Both you and the enemies can only shoot one bullet at a time. Consequently, you will have to time your attack and find the perfect opportunity to kill them.
